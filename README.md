# Transcriptio app

Welcome to the audio transcription and processing app. This project is a FastAPI application with a Gradio frontend interface, designed to provide seamless audio transcription and processing services.

### üö® This is a work in progress, pending to work on:

- Choose language to either upload audio or record it

## Features

- **FastAPI Backend**: A robust and scalable backend built with FastAPI, provides a better performance API endpoints.
- **Gradio Frontend**: A basic and interactive user interface by Gradio, allowing to easily interact with the application.
- **Audio Transcription**: Utilizes Whisper for accurate and efficient audio transcription services.
- **Audio Processing**: Librosa for advanced audio preprocessing capabilities.

## Project Structure

- **app/**:

  - `main.py`: Entry point for the FastAPI application.
  - `models.py`: Pydantic models for request and response validation.
  - **services/**: Here's the core service logic.
    - `transcription.py`: Handles audio transcription.
    - `audio_processing.py`: Manages audio preprocessing tasks.
  - **api/**: Defines the API endpoints.
    - `endpoints.py`: Contains the API routes.

- **frontend/**: The frontend interface.

  - `app.py`: Sets up the Gradio interface.

- `requirements.txt`: Required dependencies.
